				<p>Does it look interesting? <em>Not really?</em></p>
				<p>Is the backstory interesting? <em>Uh... vaguely?</em></p>
				<p>Do you just think it was really cute in Team Rocket? <em>Absolutely!</em></p>
				<p>Wobbuffet is a Gen 2 Pok√©mon that's whole shtick is just being a mirror against attacks. The mechanic is somewhat disfunctional in almost all combat scenarios due to the convoluted nature of the mechanic, but that just makes it the perfect vibe to go blasting off again with the Iconic duo that kept me watching the Anime long-after I was mostly bored of it.</p>
